### Monitoring Queries for Endpoint Response Times:

#### DataDog Response Time Measurement:

Uses the query for average response time per endpoint in DataDog. Example:

avg:my.endpoint.response.time

#### _New Relic Response Time Measurement:_

_Utilizes the query for average response time per endpoint in New Relic._

_Example:_

SELECT average(responseTime) FROM Transaction WHERE endpoint \= 'my.endpoint'.

#### _Dynatrace Response Time Measurement:_

_Employs the query for average response time per service or endpoint in Dynatrace._

_Example:_

SELECT avg(responseTime) FROM Service WHERE serviceName \= 'my.endpoint'.

_Identifying Error Issues: DataDog Error Identification: Uses queries that filter HTTP status codes to detect errors._

_Example:_

sum:my.endpoint.http.status.

#### New Relic Error Identification:

Utilizes queries that track transactions with error status codes.

Example:

SELECT count() FROM Transaction WHERE endpoint \= 'my.endpoint' AND httpResponseCode LIKE '5%'.

#### _Dynatrace Error Identification:_

_Employs queries that search for errors and exceptions in services or endpoints. Example:_

SELECT count() FROM Service WHERE serviceName \= 'my.endpoint' AND errorCount \> 0.

#### Reviewing Relevant Logs for Developers:

#### DataDog Log Analysis:

Uses log queries with specific filters for relevant events.

Example:

service:my-service ERROR.

#### New Relic Log Analysis:

Provides log queries with the ability to search and filter specific events. Example:

SELECT \* FROM Log WHERE service \= 'my-service' AND level \= 'error'.

Dynatrace Log Analysis:

Employs log queries to identify errors and exceptions in real-time. Example:

SELECT \* FROM Log WHERE service \= 'my-service' AND logType \= 'error'.

Each monitoring platform provides specific queries and filters to measure response times, identify error issues, and review relevant logs for developers. The choice among these queries will depend on the specific monitoring and analysis needs of each development team.
