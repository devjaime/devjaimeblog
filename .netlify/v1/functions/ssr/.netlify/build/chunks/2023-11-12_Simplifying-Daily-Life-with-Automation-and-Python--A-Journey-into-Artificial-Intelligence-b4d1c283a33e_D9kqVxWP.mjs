Introduction to Automation and Python:</p>\n<p>In the hustle and bustle of daily life, we often find ourselves performing repetitive tasks that consume time and energy. This is where automation comes into play, and what better way to tackle it than with Python, a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language.</p>\n<p>II. Repetitive Tasks and Python:</p>\n<p>From organizing files to scheduling emails, Python offers libraries and modules that simplify the automation of daily tasks.

Imagine downloading files to your desktop every day, and after a while, it becomes chaotic. This is where Python can work wonders.</p>\n<p>Example: Organizing Files with Python</p>\n<p>Suppose you have a folder named “Downloads” filled with files that need organizing. We’ll create a simple script that automatically categorizes these files into subfolders based on their type.</p>\n<p>import os<br>\nimport shutil</p>\n<p>def organize_files(download_path):<br>\n# List of extensions and their corresponding folders<br>\nextensions = {<br>\n‘Documents’: [‘.pdf’, ‘.docx’, ‘.txt’],<br>\n‘Images’: [‘.jpg’, ‘.png’, ‘.gif’],<br>\n‘Music’: [‘.mp3’, ‘.wav’],<br>\n‘Videos’: [‘.mp4’, ‘.mkv’]<br>\n# Add more categories as needed<br>\n}</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>\\# Iterate over each file in the Downloads folder  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>for file in os.listdir(download\\_path):  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    \\# Get the file extension  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    \\_, extension = os.path.splitext(file)  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    \\# Iterate over the categories and move the file to the corresponding folder  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    for category, allowed\\_extensions in extensions.items():  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        if extension.lower() in allowed\\_extensions:  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            destination\\_folder = os.path.join(download\\_path, category)  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            \\# Create the folder if it doesn't exist  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            if not os.path.exists(destination\\_folder):  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                os.makedirs(destination\\_folder)  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            \\# Move the file to the corresponding folder  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            shutil.move(os.path.join(download\\_path, file), os.path.join(destination\\_folder, file))  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            print(f\"File {file} moved to {destination\\_folder}\")  </span></span></code></pre>\n<p># Path to the Downloads folder<br>\ndownload_path = “/path/to/your/downloads/folder”</p>\n<p># Call the function to organize the files<br>\norganize_files(download_path)</p>\n<p>III.
